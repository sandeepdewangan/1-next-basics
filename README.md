## NextJS

### Templates and Layouts

**Layouts** let developers define a common structure that stays intact across different routes without re-rendering. This is particularly useful for components like headers, footers, and sidebars that should remain consistent as users navigate through the app.

**Templates** in Next.js also act as UI shells that wrap around pages but with a key difference: a template is fully remounted every time a user navigates to a new page.
